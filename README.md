## 📌 Project Overview
This repository hosts the professional digital portfolio for **Tamira Carter**. It is a high-performance, responsive web application designed to showcase strategic case studies in a format optimized for executive review.

Unlike standard template-based portfolios, this project is **custom-engineered** to deliver a "Zero-Friction" experience:
- **Hybrid Architecture:** A "Central Command" Hub linking to deep-dive Case Study modules, mirroring corporate reporting structures.
- **Executive-First Design:** Strict "Black & White" aesthetic for financial credibility (Cardinal Case) vs. "High-Impact" visuals for market strategy (Beyoncé Case).
- **Performance Optimized:** Hand-coded HTML5/CSS3 with no heavy frameworks, ensuring instant load times on any device.

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Core:** HTML5, CSS3 (Tailwind CSS via CDN), Vanilla JavaScript.
- **Visualization:** Responsive CSS Grid & Flexbox for complex layouts.
- **Icons:** FontAwesome 6.5.1 + Material Icons.
- **Fonts:** Google Fonts (Inter & Montserrat).
